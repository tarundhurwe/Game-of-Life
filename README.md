# Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It's a fascinating simulation that evolves over time based on a set of simple rules. This README provides instructions on how to use this implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

## Getting Started

1. **Starting the Simulation:**
   - To start the simulation, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where your Conway's Game of Life program is located.
   - Type the following command and press Enter:
     ```
     python main.py
     ```
   - This will initialize the Game of Life simulation, and you'll see the grid on your screen.

2. **Generating Random Life:**
   - While the simulation is running, you can generate random life on the grid by pressing the 'g' key on your keyboard.
   - This action will populate the grid with a random arrangement of live and dead cells, adding an element of unpredictability to the simulation.

3. **Generating Life by Clicking:**
   - You can also interactively generate life by clicking on the grid. Click on any dead cell to bring it to life.

4. **Deleting Life by Clicking:**
   - If you want to remove life from the grid, simply click on a live cell, and it will become dead.

5. **Clearing the Grid:**
   - To clear the entire grid, press the 'c' key on your keyboard.

6. **Starting and Pausing the Simulation:**
   - You can start and pause the simulation at any time by pressing the spacebar ('Space' key) on your keyboard.

Enjoy exploring the fascinating world of Conway's Game of Life with this implementation!
